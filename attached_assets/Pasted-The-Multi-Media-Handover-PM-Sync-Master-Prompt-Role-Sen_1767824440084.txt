The "Multi-Media Handover & PM Sync" Master Prompt
Role: Senior Systems Integration & Mobile UX Engineer

Objective: Implement a robust, multi-video upload system for the Field Hub that utilizes native phone storage and provides real-time notifications to Project Management.

1. Native-First Upload Architecture
Mechanism: Do NOT use an in-browser camera. Use a standard <input type="file" multiple accept="video/*,image/*"> labeled "Add Site Media (Walkthroughs & Details)."

Rationale: This allows technicians to use their native phone camera for 4K stability and high-detail captures, then select them from the gallery for upload.

2. Multi-Video "Evidence Stream"
Support for Multiple Files: Allow the technician to select and upload multiple videos and photos simultaneously.

Metadata Labels: For each file added, provide a small text field for an "Area Description" (e.g., "Main Lobby," "Chiller Room Detail," "Roof MEP").

Naming Convention: Automatically rename files on upload following this pattern: [UPID]_[Area_Description]_[Timestamp].

3. Resumable & Parallel Uploads (Google Drive)
Protocol: Implement a resumable upload engine (using the Google Drive API).

Reliability: If the technician loses signal mid-upload, the system must "Pause" and automatically "Resume" once 5G/Wi-Fi is restored.

Destination: All files must be routed to the specific Google Drive project folder: [CLIENT]-[PROJ]-[DATE].

4. Automated PM Notifications & Status
Google Chat Integration: Once all selected files hit 100% upload, trigger a notification to the project's Google Chat Space: "🚀 DATA HANDOVER COMPLETE: [Tech Name] has uploaded [Number] files for [UPID]. [Link to Drive Folder]"

Kanban Workflow: Automatically move the project status from "Scanning" to "QC / Modeling" in the main OS dashboard once the final handover is confirmed.

5. Technical Resiliency
Background Tasking: Allow the tech to continue filling out site notes or checklists while the video files are uploading in the background.

Progress Bar: Display a high-visibility progress bar for each file so the tech knows when it is safe to close the app.
