The "Agentic Scan2Plan OS" Master Prompt
Role: Senior AI Engineer & Systems Architect

Objective: Enhance Scan2Plan OS with AI Grounding for site audits and Automated Coordination via Google Chat.

1. Site Reality Audit (Vertex AI + Maps Grounding)
The Mission: Add a "Reality Check" button to the Evidence Vault.

The Logic: Use Vertex AI with Google Maps Grounding (via the Model Context Protocol).

The Action: Pass the project_address and the current scope_of_work notes to the AI.

The Goal: Ask the AI: "Analyze this building at [Address]. Our scope says it's a [Notes]. Does the Google Maps 3D data confirm this, or are there discrepancies (e.g., hidden levels, complex roof structures, HVAC density) that suggest we should re-audit the square footage?"

The Output: Generate a "Risk Report" that Kurt can review before final scheduling.

2. Automated Project Concierge (Google Chat API)
The Trigger: When the Retainer Gate is cleared (status changes to "Ready to Scan").

The Mission: Use the Google Chat API to create a dedicated Space for the project.

The Details: * Space Name: [Universal Project ID] - [Client Name]

Automated Post: Send an initial message containing:

Link to the Google Drive Parent Folder.

The Scope of Work summary.

The Universal Project ID.

Members: Automatically add the CEO, Accounting Lead, Production Lead, and the assigned Scan Tech.

3. Predictive Cashflow (BigQuery ML Integration)
The Mission: Create a "Future Outlook" card on the CEO Dashboard.

The Logic: Use the BigQuery API to run a simple ARIMA_PLUS forecast on the invoices and expenses tables.

The Visual: Display a line chart in Recharts showing "Projected Revenue vs. Operating Costs" for the next 90 days based on historical deal velocity and staleness tracking.

4. Technical Stack Requirements
API Handlers: Ensure all new Google Cloud calls are handled through a unified GoogleServicesController on the backend.

Security: Use Service Account authentication for Chat and Vertex AI to ensure 24/7 background operation without manual login.

Why this fixes your coordination problem:
The Grounding: Prevents you from sending a technician into a site that was scoped incorrectly, protecting your margins on the Square Foot Audit.

The Chat Space: Stops the "Where's the info?" noise. Every stakeholder is dropped into a room with all the data they need the moment the money clears.

The Predictive Outlook: Gives you the confidence to know exactly when to hire your next tech to stay on track for your $2.2M goal.
