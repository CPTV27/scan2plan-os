Prompt for CRM Agent:

I need your help integrating with our CPQ (Configure-Price-Quote) Calculator system. The CPQ is a separate Replit application that generates detailed pricing quotes for Scan-to-BIM services.
## Current Problem
The proposal preview is missing key data fields and has formatting issues. Here's what needs fixing:
### Missing Fields:
- Client name (showing "Dear Valued Client" instead of actual name)
- Quote number and date
- Project address
- Payment terms
- Account/site contact info
- Separate scan vs modeling cost breakdown
### Formatting Issues:
- Disciplines showing inconsistent capitalization ("structure, Architecture, mepf" should be "Architecture, Structure, MEPF")
- Area names duplicating project name instead of being distinct
- "Price Adjustment" label is unclear - needs better description
## Proposed Solution
Let's set up an API endpoint that the CPQ system can call to sync quote data. The CPQ will POST complete quote data when a quote is finalized.
### Data Structure the CPQ Can Provide:
```json
{
  "quoteNumber": "Q-2026-0051",
  "quoteDate": "2026-01-10",
  "projectName": "Test Project - Brooklyn",

What I Need From You:
Create a POST endpoint /api/cpq/sync-quote that accepts this data structure
Update your proposal template to use all these fields
Tell me what URL/auth method to use so I can configure the CPQ to POST here
Can you show me your current proposal generation code so we can align on the data mapping?
