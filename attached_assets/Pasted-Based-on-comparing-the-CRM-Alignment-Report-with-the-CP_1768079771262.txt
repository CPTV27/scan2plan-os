Based on comparing the CRM Alignment Report with the CPQ implementation, I've identified several gaps where the CRM needs to be updated to match the CPQ:

CRM Gaps to Fix
1. Per-Discipline LoD (MAJOR GAP)
CRM Has	CPQ Has
Single lod field per area	disciplineLods object with LoD per discipline
CRM should change to:

"disciplineLods": {
  "architecture": { "discipline": "architecture", "lod": "300" },
  "structure": { "discipline": "structure", "lod": "200" },
  "mepf": { "discipline": "mepf", "lod": "300" }
}
2. Missing Area Fields
CRM is missing these CPQ area fields:

Field	Type	Default	Purpose
mixedInteriorLod	Select	"300"	LoD for interior when scope=mixed
mixedExteriorLod	Select	"300"	LoD for exterior when scope=mixed
numberOfRoofs	Number	0	Roof count for pricing
facades	Array	[]	Dynamic list of facade definitions
gradeAroundBuilding	Boolean	false	Include grade survey
gradeLod	Select	"300"	LoD for grade survey
includeCad	Boolean	false	CAD deliverable flag
3. LoD Options Missing
CRM Has	CPQ Has
200, 300, 350	100, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400
Add: 100, 250, 400

4. Dispatch Location Casing
CRM Uses	CPQ Uses
WOODSTOCK, BROOKLYN, TROY, FLY_OUT	troy, woodstock, brooklyn
CRM should use lowercase values, and note that CPQ doesn't have fly_out in the UI selector (but may accept it via API).

5. Risk Factors Mismatch
CRM Has	CPQ Has
hazardous, noPower, occupied, security, historic, height	hazardous, noPower, occupied
CRM has extra risks (security, historic, height) that CPQ doesn't recognize. Either:

Remove them from CRM, OR
Add them to CPQ (you said don't change CPQ, so remove from CRM)
6. Building Type Mismatch
CRM and CPQ have different building type labels/IDs. CRM should match CPQ's list exactly:

CPQ ID	CPQ Label
1	Commercial - Simple
2	Residential - Standard
3	Residential - Luxury
4	Commercial / Office
...	(full list in CPQ spec)
7. Remove kind Field
CRM has a kind field (standard/landscape). CPQ doesn't use this - it infers from buildingType (14-15 = landscape).

Would you like me to create a detailed specification document listing exactly what the CRM team needs to change?
