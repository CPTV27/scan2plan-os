Scan2Plan OS: Sales Pipeline Roadmap

This guide outlines the current architectural strengths of the Scan2Plan OS and the roadmap for upcoming feature enhancements.

1. Current Architecture (Scan2Plan OS)

Data Persistence: Driven by a PostgreSQL backend. Unlike local-storage prototypes, all deal data is fully persistent and relational.

Probability & Forecasting: Integrated logic for weighted pipeline values is active. The dashboard dynamically calculates revenue based on stage-specific probabilities.

Multi-user Support: Replit Auth is natively integrated, ensuring secure, session-based access for different team members.

Audit Trails: createdAt, updatedAt, and lastContactDate fields are active, enabling the system to detect stale leads automatically.

CRUD Operations: Full editing capabilities are provided via the LeadForm (pencil icon), allowing for real-time updates to deal values and metadata.

Visual Hierarchy: Kanban columns use distinct styling and color-coding to differentiate funnel stages at a glance.

2. Priority Feature Roadmap

Based on recent reviews and user experience goals, the following features are slated for immediate implementation:

Global Pipeline Search

Functionality: Add a high-visibility search bar to the dashboard.

Scope: Implement client-side or server-side filtering that scans company and contact fields across all Kanban columns simultaneously.

Lead Management: Deletion

Functionality: Add a "Trash" or "Archive" icon to deal cards.

Goal: Allow users to remove cold leads or duplicate entries without manually navigating through deep edit menus.

Empty State Illustrations

Functionality: Replace blank columns with SVG-based illustrations or dashed "Drop Zone" placeholders.

Goal: Improve the visual flow and encourage lead generation activity when a specific funnel stage is empty.

3. Future Scaling Considerations

Collaborative Views: Future-proofing the specific userId paths to allow for team-wide shared pipelines or manager-only oversight views.

Staleness Alerts: Enhancing the existing date tracking with visual "hot" or "cold" indicators (e.g., a card glowing red if it hasn't been touched in 7 days).
