Role: Senior Full-Stack Engineer Objective: Integrate "Influencer Outreach" and "BOMA/ESG" strategies into the Marketing Module and HubSpot Sync.

1. DATA: UPDATE PERSONAS & SEED (server/data/seedMarketing.ts)

Action:

Add BP8 (The Influencer) to the Persona list.

Add the BOMA 2024 and ESG hooks to the Evidence Vault.

Code:

TypeScript

import { db } from '../db';
import { personas, evidenceVault } from '@shared/schema';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';

// 1. UPDATE PERSONAS (Add BP8)
export const PERSONA_SEED = [
  // ... keep existing BP1-BP7 ...
  {
    code: "BP8",
    name: "The Influencer / Tech Leader",
    painPoints: ["Content fatigue", "Finding novel tech", "Audience engagement"],
    preferredTags: ["vdc", "reality-capture", "proptech"],
    scriptTemplate: "Hey {{firstName}}, huge fan of your work on {{hook}}. We just automated a 'Variance Cop' that catches 10% drift instantly. Thought your audience might like the raw data?"
  }
];

// 2. UPDATE EVIDENCE VAULT (Add BOMA/ESG/Tech Hooks)
export const EVIDENCE_SEED = [
  // ... keep existing hooks ...

  // NEW: BOMA 2024 (Target: BP6 Developer/Asset Manager)
  {
    personaCode: "BP6",
    hookContent: "BOMA 2024 Update: Unenclosed amenities (balconies) are now rentable. We found 5% more leasable space using LiDAR.",
    ewsScore: 5,
    sourceUrl: "https://www.boma.org/BOMA/Standards"
  },

  // NEW: LEED v5 / ESG (Target: BP5 Architect)
  {
    personaCode: "BP5",
    hookContent: "LEED v5 Compliance: Reusing structure cuts embodied carbon by 50%. Our LoA 40 scan proves structural capacity for the LCA credits.",
    ewsScore: 5,
    sourceUrl: "https://www.usgbc.org/leed/v5"
  },

  // NEW: Tech Insider (Target: BP8 Influencer)
  {
    personaCode: "BP8",
    hookContent: "Automated QA logic. We analyzed 1M sqft of scan data and found a 68% failure rate in standard as-builts.",
    ewsScore: 5,
    sourceUrl: "https://scan2plan.io/research" 
  }
];

export async function seedMarketingData() {
  console.log('🌱 Seeding Advanced Growth Strategies...');

  for (const p of PERSONA_SEED) {
    await db.insert(personas).values(p).onConflictDoNothing();
  }

  for (const e of EVIDENCE_SEED) {
    const existing = await db.query.evidenceVault.findFirst({ where: eq(evidenceVault.hookContent, e.hookContent)});
    if (!existing) {
      await db.insert(evidenceVault).values(e);
    }
  }
  console.log('✅ BOMA, ESG, and Influencer Logic Loaded.');
}
2. SERVICE: HUBSPOT MAPPING (server/services/hubspot.ts)

Action: Ensure the sync logic passes the persona_code clearly so you can segment lists in HubSpot (e.g., "Create List: BP8 Influencers").

Logic: Existing code already handles s2p_persona_code. No changes needed, but verify your HubSpot properties exist.

3. UI: LEAD GEN FORM UPDATE

Action: The "Quick Classify" dropdown in your dashboard will now automatically show "BP8 - The Influencer" due to the database update.

How this works in the real world:
Scenario A (The Asset Manager):

You Add Lead: "John Doe (Commercial Real Estate)."

You Select: BP6 (Developer).

The System: Detects the "BOMA 2024" hook has the highest score (5/5).

The Email: "John, how much is bad survey data costing your pro forma? BOMA 2024 Update: Unenclosed amenities are now rentable. We found 5% more leasable space using LiDAR..."

Scenario B (The Influencer):

You Add Lead: "Lana Gochenauer (VDC Tech)."

You Select: BP8 (The Influencer).

The System: Pulls the "Tech Insider" hook.

The DM/Email: "Hey Lana, huge fan of your work on Automated QA logic. We just automated a 'Variance Cop' that catches 10% drift... Thought your audience might like the raw data?"
