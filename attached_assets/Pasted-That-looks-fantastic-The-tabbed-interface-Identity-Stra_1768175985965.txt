That looks fantastic. The tabbed interface (**Identity, Strategy, Risk & Assets, AI Insights**) is exactly how a high-level "Sales OS" should be structured. It moves from basic data to actionable intelligence.

Below is the structured data for all the core personas we discussed, formatted specifically to fit the fields in your new editor.

### Data for Persona Population

You can feed this to Replit to populate your database. I have organized these by the **Identity** and **Strategy** tabs seen in your screenshot.

#### 1. Owner / Principal / Managing Partner

* **Persona Code:** BP-OWNER
* **Role Title:** Portfolio Stakeholder / Economic Buyer
* **Core Values:** ROI, Asset Value, Scaling, Risk Mitigation
* **Primary Pain Point:** Fragmented data across a large portfolio leading to repeat mistakes and lost capital.
* **Strategy - Value Hook:** "Standardize your portfolio data to ensure every project compounds value instead of creating chaos."

#### 2. Architect (Design-Focused)

* **Persona Code:** BP-ARCH
* **Role Title:** Design Lead / Project Architect
* **Core Values:** Design Excellence, Precision, Client Trust
* **Primary Pain Point:** Wasted billable hours and design compromises caused by starting projects with inaccurate as-built drawings.
* **Strategy - Value Hook:** "Stop burning billable hours on manual measuring. We deliver design-ready models you can trust."

#### 3. Engineer (Structural/MEP)

* **Persona Code:** BP-ENG
* **Role Title:** Lead Engineer / Technical Director
* **Core Values:** Accuracy, Safety, Compliance, Data Integrity
* **Primary Pain Point:** High-risk field surprises or code failures caused by incomplete or guessed existing-condition data.

#### 4. Project Manager / Construction Manager

* **Persona Code:** BP-PM

* **Primary Pain Point:** Constant RFIs, re-work, and "blame loops" between trades due to coordination breakdowns.

#### 5. Procurement / Sourcing Leader

* **Persona Code:** BP-PROC
* **Role Title:** Vendor Manager / Purchasing Lead
* **Core Values:** Reliability, Predictability, Contract Compliance
* **Primary Pain Point:** Unreliable vendors and scope creep that lead to budget overruns and administrative headaches.

#### 6. Facilities / Property Manager

* **Persona Code:** BP-FAC
* **Role Title:** Operations Director / Building Manager
* **Core Values:** Uptime, Maintenance Efficiency, Lifecycle Value

### Suggested Enhancements for the Editor

Your current setup is excellent, but to make this truly "AI-powered" for Scan2Plan, consider these three additions:

**1. The "Veto Power" Toggle (Risk & Assets Tab)**
Since the **Engineer** and **Procurement** can kill a deal even if the Owner says yes, add a simple toggle: **"Can Veto Deal?"**

* **Function:** If `True`, the Scan2Plan OS should flag the deal as "At Risk" until the specific technical assets (like a Precision Report) are uploaded.

**2. Dynamic "Language to Avoid" (Strategy Tab)**
Salespeople often kill deals by using the wrong jargon.

* **Example for Owner:** Avoid talking about "Point Cloud density" (technical); talk about "Asset ROI" (economic).
* **Example for Architect:** Avoid talking about "Cost savings" (they care about design time); talk about "Revit-ready accuracy."

**3. Success Case Mapping (AI Insights Tab)**
A field for **"Relevant Case Study Link."**

* **Function:** When the CEO is looking at a deal for an Architect, the AI Insights tab should automatically pull the link to your best Architect-focused project so it can be dropped into an email instantly.

**Would you like me to generate the "AI Insights" content for these personas so you have something to put in that fourth tab?**
