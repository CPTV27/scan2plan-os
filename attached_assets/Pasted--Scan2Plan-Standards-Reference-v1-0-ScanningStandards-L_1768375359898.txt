### #ScanningStandards
#### Levels of Accuracy (LoA)
- **LoA 40 (Measured Accuracy):**
  - **Tolerance:** 0–1/8 inch.
  - **Application:** Point clouds generated directly from laser scans.
  - **Purpose:** Provides high-precision scan data aligned with real-world conditions.
  - **Validation Methods:**
    - **B-Validation:** Overlapping scan alignment for consistency.
    - **C-Validation:** Control points aligned with survey data.
- **LoA 30 (Modeled Accuracy):**
  - **Tolerance:** 0–1/2 inch.
  - **Application:** BIM/CAD models derived from point clouds.
  - **Purpose:** Ensures modeled geometry reflects scanned data for construction-ready deliverables.

#### Scanning Devices
- **Trimble X7:**
  - **Accuracy:** ±2mm.
  - **Features:** Colorized scans, real-time registration.
- **NavVis VLX 2:**
  - **Accuracy:** Up to 6mm.
  - **Features:** Mobile SLAM scanning for dynamic environments.

#### Scanning Process
- **Pre-Scan:**
  - Conduct site surveys to identify access points and conditions.
  - Ensure comprehensive planning to cover all required areas.
- **On-Site Execution:**
  - Perform live review to verify completeness of scan coverage.
  - Address missing data before leaving the site.
