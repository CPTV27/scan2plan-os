Here are practical ways to test the logic on the new build:

Testing Approach Options
1. Manual Test Scenarios (Quickest)
Create a test checklist with specific quotes to verify:

Test Case	Input	Expected Output
Standard project	25k sqft, Office, Arch LoD 300	Database rate lookup works
Risk premium	Add "occupied" risk	Only Architecture gets +15%
Landscape	5 acres, Natural Landscape	Uses $750/acre (LoD 300) = $3,750
Tier A detection	60k sqft project	Brooklyn travel = $0 base
Travel calc	Troy dispatch, 80 miles	$240 travel + $300 scan day fee
2. Test Payload Sender (Best for CRM Integration)
Build a simple test page that sends postMessage payloads to the CPQ iframe - simulating the CRM. This verifies all 60+ fields hydrate correctly.

3. Golden Quote Snapshots
Create 5-10 "known good" quotes in the database with verified pricing. After any changes, compare new calculations against these reference quotes.

4. Automated Unit Tests
Extract the pricing calculation functions into testable modules and write Jest tests covering:

Rate lookups by building type/tier/discipline/LoD
Risk premium math (Architecture only)
Landscape acre→sqft conversion
Travel tier detection
Integrity auditor checks
My recommendation: Start with option 2 (Test Payload Sender) - a simple page that lets you send test payloads to verify the CRM integration is receiving and processing all fields correctly. This catches the most common integration issues.

Would you like me to create:

A test payload sender page?
A manual test checklist document?
Automated unit tests for the pricing engine?
Worked for 50 seconds
yes all of the above

I'll create all three testing tools for you. Here's my approach:

Test Payload Sender Page - A simple React page at /test-payload that lets you construct and send test payloads to the CPQ, simulating the CRM integration
Manual Test Checklist - A markdown document with specific test cases covering all pricing scenarios
Unit Tests - Jest tests for the core pricing calculation functions
