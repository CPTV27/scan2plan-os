This is the final handshake between the field and the office. By integrating a "Data Handover" portal directly into the Field Hub, you eliminate the "Where is the data?" bottleneck.

Using the Google Drive API, we can ensure that the moment the tech hits "Upload," the files are routed to the specific folder created by your Nomenclature Standard ([CLIENT_CODE]-[PROJ_CODE]-[YYYYMMDD]).

Replit Prompt: The Data Handover & PM Notification
Role: Senior Systems Integration Engineer

Objective: Implement a "Final Data Handover" portal in the Field Hub that uploads files to a specific Google Drive folder and notifies the Project Manager.

1. The Upload Portal
Location: Place a "Final Data Upload" section at the bottom of the Mission Hub, visible after the [Leave Site] button is active.

Functionality: * Support multiple file uploads (Video Walkthroughs, Raw Scan Data, Site Photos).

Use the Google Drive API to target the specific project folder based on the Universal ID.

Implement a progress bar so the tech knows when the "Heavy" video files are finished.

2. Automated PM Notification
Trigger: Once the "Data Handover" is 100% complete.

Action: * Google Chat: Post a message to the project's Space: "🚀 DATA RECEIVED: [Tech Name] has uploaded the final data for [UPID]. View folder: [Drive_Link]"

OS Status Update: Automatically move the project status from "Scanning" to "QC / Modeling" in the main Production Kanban.

3. The "Square Foot Audit" Trigger
Check: If the tech noted a square footage overage in their site notes, highlight this in the PM notification: "⚠️ ATTENTION: Tech flagged a potential SF overage. Review audit required before modeling."

Visualizing the Handover Flow
Why this completes your $2.2M "Toll Booth":
Zero Latency: The Project Manager (Kurt) or the Modeler doesn't have to wait for an email. The chat notification is the "starting gun" for the next phase of production.

Data Organization: No more loose files in a "General Uploads" folder. Everything is filed correctly the moment it’s born.

Accounting Accuracy: Agata can now verify that the "End Travel" timestamp matches the time the data was actually uploaded, ensuring the tech isn't billing for "uploading from home" while on the clock.

Final Instruction for Replit (The Full OS Sync)
To make sure Replit ties this all together with your previous instructions, use this closing line:

"Architect, ensure the Google Drive destination folder is dynamically pulled from our NOMENCLATURE_STANDARDS.md logic. If the folder does not exist yet, the system should create it using the [CLIENT]-[PROJ]-[DATE] format before starting the upload."
