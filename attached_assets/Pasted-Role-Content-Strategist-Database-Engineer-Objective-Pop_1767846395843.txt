Role: Content Strategist & Database Engineer Objective: Populate the ProposalBuilder with the specific "Gold Standard" boilerplate text extracted from the client's legacy PDF proposals.

1. CREATE CONTENT REPOSITORY (server/data/proposalContent.ts)

Action: Create a static data file to house the standard text blocks.

Structure: Export constant objects for Marketing, Scope, Terms, and Standards.

2. INJECT MARKETING BOILERPLATE (The "Why Us")

Code:

TypeScript

export const MARKETING_COPY = {
  aboutUs: "We began in 2018 with a simple goal of helping firms focus on design. We're an on-demand LiDAR to BIM/CAD team that can model any building in weeks. We've scanned over 1,000 buildings (~10M sqft).",
  theDifference: [
    {
      title: "Terrestrial LiDAR Only",
      body: "While others use Drones or iPhone LiDAR, we work exclusively with the Trimble X7 on every project to guarantee millimeter accuracy from 0\" to 1/8\".",
    },
    {
      title: "No AI in the Model",
      body: "We take a 100% manual approach. For detailed MEP/Structural work, we rely on human experts, not algorithms, to ensure perfect interpretation.",
    },
    {
      title: "Rigorous QC",
      body: "Our dedicated QC team double and triple checks every deliverable. This adds a few days to delivery but saves you weeks of headaches.",
    }
  ]
};
3. INJECT SCOPE SNIPPETS (Dynamic)

Code:

TypeScript

export const SCOPE_TEMPLATES = {
  standard_scan: "A scanning technician will capture the [EXTERIOR/INTERIOR] LiDAR point cloud. Data will be registered, cleaned, and reviewed for QA.",
  lod_300_model: "Revit Model (LoD 300). Accurate geometry for coordination. All elements modeled in the 'Existing' phase. Facade geometry joined. Changes in material noted.",
  lod_350_model: "Revit Model (LoD 350). Precise geometry suitable for construction documentation. Includes detailed connections, exposed MEPF, and structural framing.",
  cad_package: "Pristine CAD drawings converted from Revit. Includes Floor Plans, Exterior Elevations, Roof Plan, and up to 4 Interior Sections."
};
4. INJECT PAYMENT TERMS (The Rules)

Code:

TypeScript

export const PAYMENT_TERMS = {
  deposit: "50% of the estimated cost is due upon engagement.",
  final: "The outstanding balance is due upon delivery, determined by the actual square footage scanned (BOMA Gross Area Standard).",
  methods: ["ACH (Preferred)", "Check (Mailed to 188 1st St, Troy, NY)"]
};
5. INJECT BIM STANDARDS MATRIX (The Checklist)

Action: Create a JSON structure for the detailed matrix found in the PDFs.

Code:

TypeScript

export const BIM_MATRIX = {
  exterior_arch: {
    walls: { lod200: true, lod300: true, lod350: true, notes: "Default Revit wall profile" },
    storefront: { lod200: true, lod300: true, lod350: true, notes: "Mullions included" },
    roof: { lod200: "Default", lod300: "Sloped at drain", lod350: "In-situ depressions" }
  },
  mep: {
    ducts: { lod200: false, lod300: true, lod350: true, notes: "Size > 8\"" },
    pipes: { lod200: false, lod300: "Size > 2\"", lod350: "Size > 1\"", notes: "Hangers included in 350" }
  }
};
6. UI UPDATE: PROPOSAL BUILDER

Target: client/src/pages/ProposalBuilder.tsx

Action: Update the sidebar to pull from MARKETING_COPY and SCOPE_TEMPLATES.

Logic:

If Owen selects "LoD 300", automatically insert the lod_300_model text block into the Scope section.

Always append PAYMENT_TERMS to the footer.
